## About Me 👋
Hi , I'm Francisco. 

I was born on 3 July 2004, in Rosario, Argentina. 😁

In 2022 I finished school and in 2023 started studying systems engineering 👨‍🎓

I'm really good at maths (I've been in the Math Olympics in 3 ocassions) 

I started programming when I was fourteen years old(In 2018). At the moment I'm really keen on HTML/CSS/JS and many more technologies referring to Web Design, Backend, etc. 
My main programming language is Javascript(and NodeJS) but I have some knowledge in Rust, C++ and Go.

I´m up for any programming/translator related job. I prefer working on commission but I don't have any problem with other types of work. 🙋‍♂️

## Technologies I use 👨‍💻

Well, as I said before, my main programming language is JavaScript.

I usually work with NodeJS and many libraries such as Axios, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Electron and many others.
